      <h1>Project 1: Notes From Lesson 1</h1>
        <p><em>In this project I wrote all of my notes from the lesson into an html
        document and styled the notes using HTML tags and elements. You can look at
        the source code <a href="https://codepen.io/kennethacurtis/pen/RgqMvP" target="_blank" alt=codepen>here</a>.</em></p><br>
      <b>The World Wide Web</b>
        <p>A collection of <em>HTML documents</em> made of of files
        that have <b>Hyper Text Markup Language</b>. The "links" between pages
        are called hyperlinks that look like <a href="www.google.com" alt=google>this</a>.
        If this link is clicked on, it will take you to google. </p>
      <b>Components of the Web</b>
        <p>The major pieces of the web are you, your web browser run by your computer,
        the Internet, and the servers. Browsers can include programs such as Internet
        Explorer, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. The servers are computers designed to store
        massive amounts of files for the computer to access from the internet.</p><br>
      <b>HTML Elements and Attributes</b>
        <p><em>HTML Elements</em> are used to tell the web browser how to display content
        web page. These elements can include the following tags:
          <ul>
            <li><b>!DOCTYPE</b> - defines the type of document</li>
            <li><b>HTML</b> - defines an HTML document</li>
            <li><b>title</b> - defines the title of the document. Is usually viewed
            on your browser toolbar</li>
            <li><b>h1-h6</b> - HTML headings</li>
            <li><b>p</b> - paragraph of the document. Makes an invisible box with text
            in it</li>
            <li><b>br</b> - inserts a line break on the page</li>
            <li><b>a</b> - an anchor tag, usually used for links on a page</li>
            <li><b>img</b> - an image tag for inserting images</li>
            <li><b>span</b> - defines a section in a document</li>
            <li><b>div</b> - similar to <em>span</em>, defines section in a document</li>
          </ul>
        <p><em>HTML</em> can also include attributes such as images and links
        represented by following tags:
          <ul>
            <li><b>a href="url">link</b> - this creates a hyperlink to the <em>href</em>
            attribute value <em>url</em> and names it <b>link</b></li>
            <li><b>img src="url" alt="text"></b> - displays the image from the <em>src</em>
            attribute value <em>url</em>, if the image is not displayed, the <em>text</em>
            from the <em>alt</em>attribute is shown</li>
          </ul>
        <p>One other thing to note about HTML, is that indents represent a new idea
        in the code</p><br>
      <b>Thinking Like a Programmer</b>
        <p>There are four different types of thinking involved in programming. These
        types of thinking aid in the understanding and problem solving process of
        programming:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Procedural Thinking</b> - involves creating perfectly clear and
            unambiguous instructions for a computer to follow</li>
            <li><b>Abstract Thinking</b> - Means finding similarity, or as programmers
            would say, <b>generally</b> amongst seemingly different things</li>
            <li><b>Systems Thinking</b> - Happens when you break a big problem down
            into smaller pieces</li>
            <li><b>Technological Empathy</b> - 		â—‹ Comes in many forms, For example,
            computer empathy is the ability to understand what a computer is, how it
            works, and what it's good and bad at doing</li>
            <li><b>Debugging</b> - A systematic process of relentlessly indentifying
            the cause</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Collect evidence</li>
                <li>Generate theories</li>
                <li>Test those theories</li>
                <li>Fix the problem</li>
              </ul>
          </ul><br>
      <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>The world wide web is a collection of <em>HTML documents</em> that have
        <b>Hyper Text Markup Language.</b> Some documents have links between other
        documents by using the <code>"a href"</code> attribute. The web uses your
        computer's browser to access the internet. The internet then accesses files
        from a server that stores all of the <b>HTML</b> documents and displays them
        to your browser. Tags and attributes make up the markup language that is HTML.
        These elements are read by the computer and then translated to display on the
        web page. These elements can include files, text, images, links, ect.</p><br>

    <h1>Project 2: A Stylish Webpage</h1>
      <p><em>For the second project, I was tasked to make a webpage styled with CSS that
      included one or more pages and also two or more sections. The code also has to pass
      a CSS and HTML validation text. Use the links below to view the project.</em><p>
